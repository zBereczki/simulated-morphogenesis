# Miskolc Method

>[…] we should emphasize the importance of understanding and comprehension, as this intervention is in many ways similar to the work of doctors. They implant something into our body/organism and hope that it is not rejected and that it improves or prolongs our life. […]
It is only much later that we should reveal what we would like to change in the existing situation, as there is also fairness in the world.
In space and time (although we see through a glass, darkly) we may have a chance to find the scale of our intervention – proportionally to the mentioned dimensions.
The two perspectives:
One: boldly hides behind its great ideas and demands them from the world. The other: tries to join the temporal process in space and the spatial process in time. It tries to understand why and what was done and built in a given place, and how it can continue today. Aware that there is only one final state in the process: death, and not even that. László Szőke, *A Miskolci Építész Műhely*, p. 47–48.

The Architectural Workshop of Miskolc was a pioneering group of architects in the city of Miskolc, Hungary, between 1977 and 1989. As a response to the crisis of Modernist urbanism, which resulted in the destruction of many historical neighbourhoods in Europe, they focused on architecture and urban design as a process, instead of the 'revolutionary' manifestos and concepts characteristic to the Modern Movement. According to the workshop, architecture is not an abstract aesthetic creation, but a response to real-life situations. In the case of urban design or any kind of design in an urban context, they tried to identify the 'force lines' in the urban fabric that can be built upon, developing architectural responses from them, and find the unique logic of the program and overlay it onto this fabric.

Their method is similar to that outlined by Christopher Alexander and his colleagues in 'A New Theory of Urban Design' (1987), but predates the publication of the latter. Due to the group's location behind the Iron Curtain and their predominantly Hungarian-language discourse, their method remained almost unknown to international audiences. Both in their and Alexander's works, time is a key factor.

In the course of my research, two – related – case studies were created to model and test the ideas described briefly above, and in detail in my [related article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385077914_The_Miskolc_Method_Modelling_the_Evolution_of_a_Natural_City_with_Recursive_Algorithms_Using_Simulated_Morphogenesis).

These models are based on the three main concepts of Simulated Morphogenesis: [semilattice structure, recursion, and open-endedness](https://zbereczki.github.io/simulated-morphogenesis/theoretical-considerations/).

# Case study 1: Simulated Morphogenesis of a generic Central European town

For this experiment – besides the principles of the Miskolc Workshop – the main inspirations were the simulation presented in Alexander's book [A Vision of a Living World](http://www.natureoforder.com/summarybk3.htm) (p. 360), and Hillier and Hanson's ideas about how a spatial structure can be created without agency ([The Social Logic of Space](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-logic-of-space/6B0A078C79A74F0CC615ACD8B250A985), p. 36).

# Case study 2: validation of the city-growing algorithm

This case study attempts to adapt the algorithm to a specific location. It is important to emphasize that the result is not a master plan, but rather an experiment that can serve as a basis for a preliminary master plan. This location is a vacant, underused, undeveloped hilltop (an urban void) near to the city centre of Miskolc. The area is surrounded by the city on three sides. The lack of roads and buildings in this area has a negative effect on the spatial integration of the surrounding neighborhoods, and this can also be seen in the presence of nearby social segregates. In the case study, using the end points of the surrounding streets as entry points, an attempt is made to simulate what it would be like if the given area was organically settled on the model of the generic experiment.

# Earlier stage

An earlier version of this project was introduced at the [13th International Space Syntax Symposium](https://www.hvl.no/en/research/conference/13sss/) in Bergen. Here, the urban block was the main unit.
