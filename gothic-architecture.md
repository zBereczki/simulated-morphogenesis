>„The post-Albertian architecture of our digital future will have something in common with the pre-Albertian architecture of our artisanal past, but this does not mean that digital architecture might or should look Gothic–nor any other style. […] Similar processes do not necessarily beget similar shapes. Understanding these processes, on contrary, will help us shape better things.” Mario Carpo, [The Alphabet and the Algorithm](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262515801/the-alphabet-and-the-algorithm/), p. 128.

>„The complex and procedurally based formal order of Gothic architecture, in fact, offers a highly sophisticated alternative to the classical tradition, one with real relevance for present-day architectural practice. […] Geometrical analysis of Gothic design thus has the potential to enrich architectural practice in the twenty-first century, in much the same way that formal and archaeological analysis of Gothic buildings enriched architecture in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.” Robert Bork, [Dynamic Unfolding and the Conventions of Procedure: Geometric Proportioning Strategies in Gothic Architectural Design](https://journal.eahn.org/article/id/7473/), p. 1–2.

On this page, a few animations are included to illustrate the procedural nature of Gothic architecture and microarchitecture. The models are part of my research and were created using [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com).

The models are based on the three main concepts of Simulated Morphogenesis: [semilattice structure, recursion, and open-endedness](https://zbereczki.github.io/simulated-morphogenesis/theoretical-considerations/).

# Basel Goldschmiederisse

These models were featured in the [presentation by Martin Schwarz](https://caa.confex.com/caa/2025/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/23015) (University of Basel) at the 113th Annual Conference of the College Art Association, held at the Hilton Midtown in New York.

# Altar crowns of St. Martin's church, Spišska Kapitula, Slovakia

These models were created as part of the University of Vienna’s research project [Visual Media and Spatial Contexts in Pre-Reformation Central Europe: The Sacred Ensemble in Spiš (Slovakia), c. 1425-1525](https://backend.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=132122&L=2), led by researcher Tim Juckes.

# Sacrament houses

This is an ongoing project.  
The models shown here are based on the sacrament house of St. Elizabeth’s Church in Košice, Slovakia, and were presented at the [Nexus Conference 2025: Relationships between Architecture and Mathematics](https://www.dicea.unipd.it/nexus-conference-2025-relationships-between-architecture-and-mathematics) held at the Palladio Museum in Vicenza.

# Recursive definition in action: complexity as a function of size

Using recursion, a single pinnacle-generating algorithm can be used to generate large, complex Gothic towers. In the model presented here, the complexity of the structure is a function of its size.
